# FigmaSharp – Create apps with Figma

> Here at Microsoft we ❤️ [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). We use it for everything and anything. So much so, we thought why not use it to actually implement our user interfaces? Sounds crazy enough to work. Let's give this a go.

FigmaSharp turns your Figma design into .NET objects and can generate code and layout files to create native apps. Free and Open Source software under the [MIT LICENSE]().

# Getting started

**Important note: Although FigmaSharp is a multiplatform toolkit, at the moment since we are a small team, we only give full support on Mac, so it may happen that many functionalities are not yet implemented other toolkits**

We recommend reading through the [Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/FigmaSharp/wiki) to get a sense of the FigmaSharp workflow.

To get documents from [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) you'll need to generate a **Personal Access Token**.
Sign in to Figma and in the main menu, go to **Help and Account  →  Account Settings** and select **Create new token**.
This will be your only chance to copy the token, so make sure you keep a copy in a secure place.

Try out automatic builds of the FigmaSharp app and Visual Studio extension from the [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/FigmaSharp/releases) page.

## FigmaSharp App

To preview in realtime the views generated by the library we have the FigmaSharp.App tool, which allows us to load a url of any document in your Figma account and render in real time with the tookit selected.

## Visual Studio Extension

The [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) extension contains the tools to preview Figma documents and generate Packages ready to use in your projects. Download the .mpack from the [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/FigmaSharp/releases) page.

# Building from source

Make sure to have the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Also install Xamarin.Mac, you can get it via the Visual Studio for Mac Installer.

Open `FigmaSharp.Mac.sln` in [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/). For each project in the `Tools` or `Samples` folder you want to run, open the project's **Project Options**, go to **Run → Configurations → Default** and add an environment variable called `TOKEN`, then paste in the **Personal Access Token** for your Figma account.

## Installing Visual Studio for Mac Extension


Select `MonoDevelop.Figma`  in the target selector in the toolbar and run it. This will start a new Visual Studio for Mac instance with the extension enabled. Alternatively, you can run `make` in the FigmaSharp source folder. This will generate a **.mpack** file that can be installed on other computers.

 and it contains the tools to preview and generate Xamarin.Mac code from Figma Documents created in your Figma account. 

This generates bundles with assets in the selected project in the project

 Packages ready to use in your projects. Download the .mpack from the [Releases](https://github.com/netonjm/FigmaSharp/releases) page. Install it via **Visual Studio → Extensions → Install from file…**.

The FigmaSharp app previews Figma documents without having to install Visual Studio. Download the .app from the [Releases](https://github.com/netonjm/FigmaSharp/releases) page.
